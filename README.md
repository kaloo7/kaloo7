## 🚀 Hi, I'm Khalid
Software Engineer | Project Manager | Aspiring Full Stack web Developer

I’m a backend-heavy developer currently bridging the gap to the front-end to build complete, end-to-end web applications. I bring a security-first mindset and a project management edge to everything I build.

🛠 Tech Toolbox
Languages: Java, Python, SQL

Operating Systems: Linux (Power User)

Security: Bug Bounty, Social Engineering

PM: Agile, Scrum, Team Leadership

🏗️ What I’m Working On
🌐 Full Stack Transition: Currently mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks.

🔐 Secure Dev: Applying my bug bounty experience to build "unhackable" web apps.

🐍 Automation: Writing Python scripts to streamline my Linux workflows.

⚡ Fun Fact
I have a background in Social Engineering. It taught me that most "bugs" aren't in the code—they're in the human logic. I use that insight to manage projects and people more effectively.
